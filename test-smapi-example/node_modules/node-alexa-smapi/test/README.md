# About the node-alexa-smapi test suite
This test suite can be executed in one of four modes:
- **Unit** mode: will use the responses stored in test/data/responses.json to execute the test suite.
- **Integration** mode: will connect live to Alexa SMAPI servers to execute the test suite (excluding certification tests).
- **Certification** mode: will connect live to Alexa SMAPI servers to execute the test suite (including certification tests).
- **Capture** mode: will connect live to Alexa SMAPI servers to execute the test suite (including certification tests) and store the responses in test/data/responses.json.

All modes will perform the following actions:
- Retrieve a valid access_token and keep it for use in all SMAPI invocations (**unit** mode will use a dummy access_token).
- List all vendors and use the first vendor (account) in the list to create a test skill.
- Invoke all SMAPI operations against this test skill and retry failed invocations as many as (test configuration flag) `MAX_RETRIES` times.
- Will sleep before retries when receiving a `429` rate limiting status.
- In all test modes except **integration** mode the following will happen:
  - Submit skill for certification. In all test modes except **unit** mode: **The owner of the vendor (account) should expect a certification submission email from Amazon and may receive a certification feedback on as well ;-)**
  - Withdraw skill from certification
- Remove the test skill after all SMAPI testing is complete.
- In all test modes except **unit** mode: if a test run fails, you may need to **manually clean up the test skill** created during the failed test run. **This may include withdrawing it from certification.**

# About the test skill created by this test suite
By default the test skill created will have:
- Name: node-alexa-smapi test skill
- Logo: a bug over a blue background [see it here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/node-alexa-smapi/icons/icon_512_A2Z.png).
- These default values may be changed in the manifest files under test/data

# node-alexa-smapi test suite requirements
Please follow the steps below in order to successfully run this test suite (in all test modes except **unit** mode):
- First obtain refreshToken, clientId, and clientSecret
  - Follow [these instructions](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/ask-cli-command-reference.html#util-command) to retrieve clientId and clientSecret.
  - Run `ask util generate-lwa-tokens` to generate a refreshToken (copy the value from refresh_token and use it to initialize refreshToken in the next step).
- Then create and populate the file test/data/secrets.json with the following information:
  - refreshToken (starts with "Atzr|")
  - clientId
  - clientSecret

Sample `test/data/secrets.json`:
```
{
	"refreshToken": "generated by ask util generate-lwa-tokens",
	"clientId": "amzn1.application-oa2-client.myClientId",
	"clientSecret": "myClientSecret"
}

```

# Travis CI build requirements
It is recommended to run the test suite in **unit** mode during Travis CI builds. No additional configuration is needed, as **unit** mode is the default test mode.

# Test configuration options
Due to the asynchronous nature of the `integration`, `certification`, and `capture` test modes, you may need to adjust one of the following configuration parameters so the test suite will complete successfully.

```javascript
const TEST_TYPE = ['unit', 'integration', 'certification', 'capture'].includes(process.env.TEST_TYPE) ? process.env.TEST_TYPE : 'unit';
// TEST_TYPE = 'unit' will run unit tests locally (completes in milliseconds). This is the default value.
// TEST_TYPE = 'integration' will run non-certification integration tests against SMAPI (completes in around 3 minutes).
// TEST_TYPE = 'certification' same as integration plus will run the Skill Certification test cases (completes in around 20 minutes).
// TEST_TYPE = 'capture' same as certification plus will capture the responses.
const LOG_RESPONSES = false; // if true will output (console.log) the response received by each SMAPI operation
const LOG_ERRORS = true; // if true will output (console.log) any unexpected response received from SMAPI
const MAX_RETRIES = shouldMock(TEST_TYPE) ? 0 : 10; // number of times the test suite will check for completion of create/update operations before proceeding with other test cases
const RETRY_TIMEOUT = shouldMock(TEST_TYPE) ? 0 : 10000; // time (in milliseconds) to wait before checking again for completion of create/update operations
const WITHDRAWAL_TIMEOUT = shouldMock(TEST_TYPE) ? 0 : 1 * 60 * 1000; // time (in milliseconds) to wait before withdrawing skill from certification
const MOCHA_TIMEOUT = WITHDRAWAL_TIMEOUT + 10000; // for details see https://mochajs.org/#timeouts
```
